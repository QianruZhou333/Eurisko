Task 1: Focusing on Compose

    All the IfParts of H7(Instantiate a concept having no known instances)
 are satisfied, so we are applying the ThenParts. 

the ThenAddToAgenda slot of H7 has been applied successfully to Compose

Since Compose has no known Applics, it is probably worth looking for some.

the ThenPrintToUser slot of H7 has been applied successfully to Compose

    All the ThenParts of  H7(Instantiate a concept having no known instances)
 have been successfully executed.  

    All the IfParts of H1-6NIL are satisfied, so we are applying the ThenParts.

Task 3: Focusing on PerfSquare

    All the IfParts of H7(Instantiate a concept having no known instances)
 are satisfied, so we are applying the ThenParts. 

the ThenAddToAgenda slot of H7 has been applied successfully to PerfSquare

Since PerfSquare has no known Examples, it is probably worth looking for some.

the ThenPrintToUser slot of H7 has been applied successfully to PerfSquare

    All the ThenParts of  H7(Instantiate a concept having no known instances)
 have been successfully executed.
