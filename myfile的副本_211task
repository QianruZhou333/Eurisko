    All the IfParts of H7(Instantiate a concept having no known instances)
 are satisfied, so we are applying the ThenParts. 

the ThenAddToAgenda slot of H7 has been applied successfully to H18

Since H18 has no known Applics, it is probably worth looking for some.

 conjec :Since some applications of H4 i.e., (about concepts Gather data new empirical)
 are very valuable, so EURISKO wants to find new concepts which are slightly more generalized than H4
