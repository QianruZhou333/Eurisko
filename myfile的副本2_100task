Task 1: Focusing on Compose

    All the IfParts of H7(Instantiate a concept having no known instances)
 are satisfied, so we are applying the ThenParts. 

the ThenAddToAgenda slot of H7 has been applied successfully to Compose

Since Compose has no known Applics, it is probably worth looking for some.

the ThenPrintToUser slot of H7 has been applied successfully to Compose

    All the ThenParts of  H7(Instantiate a concept having no known instances)
 have been successfully executed.  

    All the IfParts of H1-6NIL are satisfied, so we are applying the ThenParts. 

    All the ThenParts of  H1-6NIL have been successfully executed.  

Task 2: Working on a new promising task (It is AlmostCertain (845) that finding Applics of Compose 
will be worthwhile, since: ((To properly study Compose we must gather empirical data about instances 
of that concept)))

  The IfWorkingOnTask  slot of heuristic H11(Applics (f) may be found by running Alg (f) on members of
 u''s Domain) applies to the current task. 

the ThenCompute slot of H11 has been applied successfully to (845 Compose Applics ((To properly study 
Compose we must gather empirical data about instances of that concept)) ((CreditTo H7)))

Task 3: Focusing on PerfSquare

    All the IfParts of H7(Instantiate a concept having no known instances)
 are satisfied, so we are applying the ThenParts. 

the ThenAddToAgenda slot of H7 has been applied successfully to PerfSquare

Since PerfSquare has no known Examples, it is probably worth looking for some.

the ThenPrintToUser slot of H7 has been applied successfully to PerfSquare

    All the ThenParts of  H7(Instantiate a concept having no known instances)
 have been successfully executed.  

    All the IfParts of H1-6NIL are satisfied, so we are applying the ThenParts. 

    All the ThenParts of  H1-6NIL have been successfully executed.  

Task 4: Working on a new promising task (It is AlmostCertain (825) that finding Examples of PerfSquare
 will be worthwhile, since: ((To properly study PerfSquare we must gather empirical data about 
instances of that concept)))

 applies to the current task. 
the ThenCompute slot of H9 was applied to (825 PerfSquare Examples ((To properly study PerfSquare we

the ThenAddToAgenda slot of H10 was applied to (825 PerfSquare Examples ((To properly study PerfSquare

, but for some reason it signalled a failure.

  The IfWorkingOnTask  slot of heuristic H15(If C is Range (f) , then Exs (C) can be gotten from 
Applics (f)) applies to the current task. 

the ThenCompute slot of H15 has been applied successfully to (825 PerfSquare Examples ((To properly 
study PerfSquare we must gather empirical data about instances of that concept)) ((CreditTo H7)))

Ha! this task was ALREADY on the agenda: (It is Possible (412) that finding Examples of PerfSquare 
will be worthwhile, since: ((Had to suspend whilst gathering Applics of (Square)) (To properly study 
PerfSquare we must gather empirical data about instances of that concept)))
So instead of adding this as a NEW task, we just stick on the reasons ((Had to suspend whilst 
gathering Applics of (Square))), and boost the priority to 612.

Ha! this task was ALREADY on the agenda: (It is AlmostCertain (824) that finding Applics of Square 
will be worthwhile, since: ((Recent task was stymied for lack of such applics; namely, trying to find

So instead of adding this as a NEW task, we just stick on the reasons NIL, and boost the priority to 
844.

Hmmm... can't proceed with this until some Applics of (Square) are known.

the ThenAddToAgenda slot of H15 was applied to (825 PerfSquare Examples ((To properly study PerfSquare

The results of this task were: ((NewTasks (9 specific slots of H4 to find Generalizations of)))

Task 97: Working on a new promising task (It is Probable (626) that finding Generalizations of H4 will
 be worthwhile, since: ((A new unit will be created by generalizing the  ThenAddToAgenda  slot of  H4 
; that slot was chosen randomly.)))

  The IfWorkingOnTask  slot of heuristic H18(Generalize a given slot of a given unit)
 applies to the current task. 


Hmmm... couldn't seem to find any meaningful generalization of the ThenAddToAgenda slot of H4
the ThenCompute slot of H18 was applied to (626 H4 Generalizations ((
A new unit will be created by generalizing the  ThenAddToAgenda  slot of  H4 
; that slot was chosen randomly.)) ((SlotToChange ThenAddToAgenda) (CreditTo H17 H16)))
, but for some reason it signalled a failure.
The results of this task were: NIL

Task 98: Working on a new promising task (It is Probable (626) that finding Generalizations of H4 will
 be worthwhile, since: ((A new unit will be created by generalizing the  IfPotentiallyRelevant 
 slot of  H4 ; that slot was chosen randomly.)))

  The IfWorkingOnTask  slot of heuristic H18(Generalize a given slot of a given unit)
 applies to the current task. 


Hmmm... couldn't seem to find any meaningful generalization of the IfPotentiallyRelevant slot of H4

Task 99: Working on a new promising task (It is Possible (560) that finding Generalizations of H4 will
 be worthwhile, since: ((A new unit will be created by generalizing the  Applics  slot of  H4 
; that slot was chosen randomly.)))

  The IfWorkingOnTask  slot of heuristic H18(Generalize a given slot of a given unit)
 applies to the current task. 


Hmmm... couldn't seem to find any meaningful generalization of the Applics slot of H4
the ThenCompute slot of H18 was applied to (560 H4 Generalizations ((
A new unit will be created by generalizing the  Applics  slot of  H4 ; that slot was chosen randomly.)
) ((SlotToChange Applics) (CreditTo H17 H16))), but for some reason it signalled a failure.
The results of this task were: NIL

Task 100: Working on a new promising task (It is Possible (552) that finding Generalizations of H4 
will be worthwhile, since: ((A new unit will be created by generalizing the  Abbrev  slot of  H4 
; that slot was chosen randomly.)))

  The IfWorkingOnTask  slot of heuristic H18(Generalize a given slot of a given unit)
 applies to the current task. 

Inside the Abbrev slot, 

the ThenCompute slot of H18 has been applied successfully to (552 H4 Generalizations ((
